            <img src="zooposter.jpg" alt="zoo poster featuring a red panda" width="33%vp">
            <p>This was a project for school that took a couple hours. It was difficult trying to fit the red panda into the design but I eventually got it. When making it, I had a lower end laptop. Recently I got a new one and was amazed by the difference in colors. This is the first time I've seen the poster since and I'm appaulded by blinding colors. I'll have to done them done. </p>
